# Life_expectancy
1.The dataset related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the WHO data repository website and 
its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website.
Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.

2.Initially there are many null values in the data set. I some how handled them using Techniques like Zfill,bfill, and filling with mean, median or mode 
based on the appropriate ones to the particular feature

Got an accuracy of approximately 84% with linear Regression and 93% with Decision Tree Regressor

Trying to improve the accuracy with Linear Regression. if some one has the Idea please Share it. open for any new ideas.
